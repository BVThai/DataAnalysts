## Project Overview

This project focused on building and optimizing models to predict cryptocurrency prices. The work involved data analysis, feature selection, and collaboration with the team to interpret results and provide actionable insights.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Model Development**: Built and optimized models to predict cryptocurrency prices with both short-term and long-term forecasts.
- **Data Analysis and Feature Selection**: Conducted thorough data analysis and selected key features for accurate model predictions.
- **Collaboration and Insights**: Worked closely with the team to interpret results and provide insights based on model outcomes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessed historical cryptocurrency price data to ensure accurate modeling.
- **Forecast Generation**: Generated both short-term and long-term price forecasts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of different prediction models to determine the most effective approach.

## Technology Stack and Skills

- **Data Preparation (Python, Pandas, NumPy)**: Utilized Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **ARIMA (statsmodels)**: Applied ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) using the statsmodels library to analyze and forecast cryptocurrency prices. ARIMA combines autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components to accurately predict price fluctuations in the short to medium term.
- **GRU (TensorFlow/Keras)**: Utilized GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) with TensorFlow/Keras to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in cryptocurrency price data. GRU, with its simpler structure compared to LSTM, is designed to effectively capture trends and complex fluctuations in price movements.
- **MLP (TensorFlow/Keras)**: Deployed Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in TensorFlow/Keras to learn and predict non-linear patterns in cryptocurrency price data. MLP serves as a foundational model for comparison with other time-series forecasting algorithms.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Employed various metrics to evaluate and compare model performance.
- **Data Visualization (Matplotlib)**: Used Matplotlib to create visual representations of the data, model predictions, and performance metrics to facilitate analysis and interpretation.
